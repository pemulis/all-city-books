# All City Books

A system for managing inventory, sales, and data analysis for a small book business, using a Rails API backend, a React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database. This is a personal project to help me with my active bookselling business, which is mostly based on Amazon for the moment. This system will help grow that sales channel and branch out into others.
